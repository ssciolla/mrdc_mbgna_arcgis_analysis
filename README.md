# ArcGIS to MySQL Transformation Script

#### Script Author(s): Sam Sciolla
#### Created as part of the Migrating Research Data Collections project

## Purpose

This repository contains a Python script designed to convert the table and relationship JSON data about an ArcGIS database (fetched using a REST API) into a MySQL script with CREATE statements for the tables and layers. The JSON data contains extended information about tables, fields, and relationships. Using these details, the script produces a series of CREATE TABLE statements, ordered so that the tables with no foreign keys would be created first, followed by the tables with foreign keys to those, and so on. In combination with software such as [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/), this script can be used to quickly create an enhanced entity-relationship diagram.

## Use

To run this script, type the following at your command prompt of choice.

`python transform_arcgis_json_to_sql.py`

## Input

This script has no file inputs. By default, it will collect data from the URL for the Matthaei-Nichols Living Collections Database, a live ArcGIS database. To use the script on another database, simply change the values for `arcgis_database_base_url` and `new_database_name` under Main Program (at the end of the script). The URL should point to a Services Directory for the database. The [ArcGIS REST API](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/using-the-services-directory.htm) provides documentation on Services Directories and their use. `new_database_name` should contain the name of a MySQL database that the SQL output might be executed against.

## Output

This script will produce three files: `arcgis_response.json`, `relationship_matches.json`, and `database_tables.sql`. `arcgis_response.json` contains the JSON response received from the ArcGIS REST API (keep in mind responses are cached; delete the cache file to collect new data). `relationship_matches.json` stores reconfigured data about table relationships, resulting in a record for each relationship that includes the names of both tables and cardinalities. `database_tables.sql` lays out the tables described in JSON as CREATE TABLE statements, ordered so that tables with foreign keys follow the tables they reference.

## Dependencies

This script uses the [requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) library to interact with the ArcGIS REST API. It also employs the standard Python `json` library.
